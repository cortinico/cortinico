# Hi everyone 👋

My name is **Nicola** (he/him) and if there is one thing that wakes me up in the morning...this is **open source development** 🐧!

- ❤️ I'm currently maintaining several open source libraries such as [Detekt](https://github.com/detekt/detekt), [Chucker](https://github.com/ChuckerTeam/chucker), [AppIntro](https://github.com/AppIntro/AppIntro) and more.
- 🎙 If you're into open source, make sure you don't miss my podcast: [**The Developers' Bakery**](https://thebakery.dev)
